# RippleWeave: a very pretty function grapher

This project was started when I was a Desmos-wielding young'un. I hadn't heard of ShaderToy or GraphToy back then, and was completely oblivious to the world of WebGL. RippleWeave is intended to be a more restricted 2D function renderer aimed more at artistic display than calculation.
